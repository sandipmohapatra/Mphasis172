Thread :-
--------
The thread is a sort of execution of instruction 
In a program it start from public static void main(String arg[])
Statement start executing one after the other.

MultiThread :-
-------------------
In an application that is able to manage and coordinate multiple tasks simultaneously is called concurrent, multithread application.
Multithreaded applications make use of thread switching and scheduling that allow 
multiple threads to make use of system resources.
To create a multithread application we have to implement runnable interface or extends Thread class.
In runnable interface we have one abstract method ->run()
In Thread class we have different methods.

Life cycle of Thread :-
-------------------------
new born thread,
start,
runnable(choose of thread),
running,
block/wait/sleep,
dead

methods of Thread:-
1)getName():-Obtain the thread name.

2)isAlive():- check if a thread is still running.

3)run() :-Entry point for the thread.

4)start():-Start a thread by calling the run method.

5)yield():-this method pauses the currently executing thread temporarily for giving chance to the remaining waiting threads of same priority to execute. if there is no 
waiting thread or all the waiting thread have a lower
priority then the same thread will continue its execution.

6)join():-if any executing thread t1 calls join() on t2 example:- t2.join();
then immediately t1 enter into waiting state until t2 completes its execution.

7)sleep():-Based on our requirement we can make a thread to be in sleeping state 
for a specified period of time.

8)setPriority():-To change the priority of the thread.

9)getPriority() :-To get the thread priority.
MIN_PRIORITY=1 to 4
NORM_PRIORITY=5
MAX_PRIORITY=6 to 10

10)Daemon Thread() :-It is a low priority thread which run in the background doing the garbage collection operation .

11)wait() :-Thread will go to wait until some other thread doesnot notify.

12)notify() :- Wakes up a thread that called wait() on some thread. 

13)notifyAll() :-wakes up all the thread that called wait()on some object.

Synchronization:-
--------------------
When two or more threads need access to a shared resource,  need some way to 
ensure that the resource will be used by only one thread at a time. The process by 
which it is achieved is called synchronization.

DeadLock:-
-------------
When two threads are waiting each other and cannot procced the program is said to 
be deadlock.
